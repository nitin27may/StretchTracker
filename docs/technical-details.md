# Technical Details

## Motion Detection System

The Stretch Reminder App uses a sophisticated combination of OpenCV for basic motion detection and TensorFlow.NET for advanced pose detection capabilities.

### Current Motion Detection Implementation

The current motion detection system uses OpenCV to:

1. Capture video frames from the webcam
2. Convert frames to grayscale and apply Gaussian blur for noise reduction
3. Calculate frame differences to detect movement
4. Apply thresholds to distinguish significant movements from minor ones
5. Count successful stretches when sustained movement exceeds calibrated thresholds

```csharp
// Example of motion detection implementation
private async Task<bool> ProcessFrameForMotionAsync(Mat frame)
{
    // Convert to grayscale for processing
    using (Mat grayFrame = new Mat())
    {
        Cv2.CvtColor(frame, grayFrame, ColorConversionCodes.BGR2GRAY);
        Cv2.GaussianBlur(grayFrame, grayFrame, new Size(21, 21), 0);
        
        // Compute difference between current and previous frame
        using (Mat diff = new Mat())
        {
            Cv2.Absdiff(grayFrame, _previousFrame, diff);
            
            // Apply threshold to ignore small movements
            Cv2.Threshold(diff, diff, 30, 255, ThresholdTypes.Binary);
            
            // Compute amount of motion (sum of all white pixels)
            double motionAmount = Cv2.Sum(diff)[0];
            
            // Check if motion exceeds threshold
            bool isStretching = motionAmount > _motionThreshold && !_isCalibrating;
            
            return isStretching;
        }
    }
}
```

### TensorFlow.NET Integration

The app integrates TensorFlow.NET to enhance the motion detection with machine learning-based pose estimation. This integration enables:

1. **Human Pose Detection**: Identifying key body joints and their positions
2. **Pose Classification**: Recognizing specific stretching poses
3. **Movement Quality Analysis**: Analyzing the effectiveness of stretches

```csharp
// TensorFlow model loading (pseudocode - implementation in progress)
private void LoadPoseDetectionModel()
{
    // Load TensorFlow model for pose detection
    using var graph = new TF.Graph();
    using var session = new TF.Session(graph);
    
    // Load saved model from disk
    graph.Import(Path.Combine(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory, "Models", "pose_detection_model"));
    
    _poseDetectionModel = session;
}

// Pose detection implementation (pseudocode - implementation in progress)
private async Task<PoseData> DetectPoseAsync(Mat frame)
{
    // Convert frame to tensor format
    var tensor = ImageToTensor(frame);
    
    // Run inference
    var output = _poseDetectionModel.Run(
        new[] { _poseDetectionModel.Graph["input"][0] },
        new[] { tensor },
        new[] { _poseDetectionModel.Graph["output"][0] }
    );
    
    // Process detected keypoints
    return ProcessPoseOutput(output);
}
```

## Calibration System

A key aspect of the movement detection is the automatic calibration system, which:

1. Captures baseline motion data during the first few seconds
2. Establishes dynamic thresholds based on the user's environment
3. Adjusts sensitivity parameters based on user settings

This calibration ensures the app works well in various lighting conditions and with different webcam qualities.

## Future Enhancements

The TensorFlow integration is currently being refined to improve:

1. **Specific Pose Recognition**: Better identification of different stretch types
2. **Posture Analysis**: Feedback on stretch quality and form
3. **Personalized Recommendations**: Custom stretch suggestions based on user history

These enhancements will make the app more accurate in detecting genuine stretching movements and reduce false positives.
