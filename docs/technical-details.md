## Motion Detection System

> The app leverages computer vision techniques through OpenCvSharp4 to process and analyze webcam video frames in real-time, detecting user movements with precision.
</div>

The current motion detection system implements a multi-stage approach using **OpenCvSharp4**, a powerful .NET wrapper for OpenCV:

1. **Frame Acquisition**: Capture video frames from the webcam using `VideoCapture`
2. **Pre-processing**:
   - Convert frames to grayscale using `Cv2.CvtColor` with `ColorConversionCodes.BGR2GRAY`
   - Apply Gaussian blur with `Cv2.GaussianBlur` using a 21x21 kernel to reduce noise
3. **Motion Detection**:
   - Store previous frame for comparison
   - Calculate absolute difference between frames using `Cv2.Absdiff`
   - Apply binary threshold with `Cv2.Threshold` to create a binary image where white pixels represent motion
4. **Noise Reduction**:
   - Apply morphological operations:
     - `Cv2.Erode` to remove small noise points
     - `Cv2.Dilate` to enhance true motion areas
5. **Movement Quantification**:
   - Sum all white pixels with `Cv2.Sum` to get a numerical value for motion intensity
   - Compare against dynamic threshold to identify significant movement
6. **Sequential Validation**:
   - Track consecutive frames with motion to filter out random spikes
   - Only trigger "stretch detected" when multiple consecutive frames show significant motion

```csharp
// Core motion detection implementation
private async Task<bool> ProcessFrameForMotionAsync(Mat frame)
{
    // Convert to grayscale for processing
    using (Mat grayFrame = new Mat())
    {
        Cv2.CvtColor(frame, grayFrame, ColorConversionCodes.BGR2GRAY);
        Cv2.GaussianBlur(grayFrame, grayFrame, new Size(21, 21), 0);
        
        // Compute difference between current and previous frame
        using (Mat diff = new Mat())
        {
            Cv2.Absdiff(grayFrame, _previousFrame, diff);
            
            // Apply threshold to ignore small movements
            Cv2.Threshold(diff, diff, 30, 255, ThresholdTypes.Binary);
            
            // Apply morphological operations to filter noise
            var kernel = Cv2.GetStructuringElement(MorphShapes.Rect, new Size(5, 5));
            Cv2.Erode(diff, diff, kernel, iterations: 1);
            Cv2.Dilate(diff, diff, kernel, iterations: 2);
            
            // Compute amount of motion (sum of all white pixels)
            double motionAmount = Cv2.Sum(diff)[0];
            
            // Track consecutive motion frames for robustness
            bool currentFrameHasMotion = motionAmount > _motionThreshold && !_isCalibrating;
            if (currentFrameHasMotion)
                _consecutiveMotionFrames++;
            else
                _consecutiveMotionFrames = 0;
                
            // Only consider it stretching if we have enough consecutive motion frames
            bool isStretching = _consecutiveMotionFrames >= _requiredConsecutiveFrames;
            
            return isStretching;
        }
    }
}
```

### Key OpenCV Features Utilized

The motion detection system leverages several fundamental OpenCV capabilities:

- **Image Processing Operations**: For noise reduction and feature extraction
- **Binary Thresholding**: To distinguish between significant and insignificant motion
- **Morphological Transformations**: To clean up the binary image and enhance detection quality
- **Frame Differencing**: To identify changes between consecutive frames
- **Visual Feedback**: Overlaying detection status and metrics on the video feed

### TensorFlow.NET Integration

> **Machine Learning Technology**
>
> The application incorporates TensorFlow.NET to deploy advanced neural networks that can recognize human poses and specific stretching movements with high accuracy.
</div>

The app integrates TensorFlow.NET to enhance the motion detection with machine learning-based pose estimation. This integration enables:

1. **Human Pose Detection**: Identifying key body joints and their positions
   - Tracks 17 key body points including shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles
   - Calculates joint angles to verify proper stretching form
   - Operates at 15-30 FPS on standard hardware

2. **Pose Classification**: Recognizing specific stretching poses
   - Distinguishes between different types of stretches (arm, neck, back, etc.)
   - Validates proper execution against reference models
   - Provides real-time feedback on stretch quality

3. **Movement Quality Analysis**: Analyzing the effectiveness of stretches
   - Measures range of motion during stretches
   - Detects incomplete or improper stretching movements
   - Offers guidance for improving stretch effectiveness

```csharp
// TensorFlow model loading (pseudocode - implementation in progress)
private void LoadPoseDetectionModel()
{
    // Load TensorFlow model for pose detection
    using var graph = new TF.Graph();
    using var session = new TF.Session(graph);
    
    // Load saved model from disk
    graph.Import(Path.Combine(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory, "Models", "pose_detection_model"));
    
    _poseDetectionModel = session;
}

// Pose detection implementation (pseudocode - implementation in progress)
private async Task<PoseData> DetectPoseAsync(Mat frame)
{
    // Convert frame to tensor format
    var tensor = ImageToTensor(frame);
    
    // Run inference
    var output = _poseDetectionModel.Run(
        new[] { _poseDetectionModel.Graph["input"][0] },
        new[] { tensor },
        new[] { _poseDetectionModel.Graph["output"][0] }
    );
    
    // Process detected keypoints
    return ProcessPoseOutput(output);
}
```

## Automatic Calibration System

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
{: .note }
The calibration system uses statistical analysis of motion patterns to establish baseline thresholds, ensuring reliable detection across different environments and hardware configurations.
</div>

A key aspect of the movement detection is the automatic calibration system, which:

1. **Baseline Establishment**: Captures baseline motion data during the first few seconds
   ```csharp
   _backgroundMotion = (_backgroundMotion * (_calibrationFrames - 1) + motionAmount) / _calibrationFrames;
   ```

2. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Establishes dynamic thresholds based on the user's environment
   ```csharp
   _motionThreshold = Math.Max(150000, _backgroundMotion * 10); // Set threshold higher than baseline
   ```

3. **Environment Adaptation**: Adjusts sensitivity parameters based on detected ambient conditions
   ```csharp
   // Dynamically adjust parameters based on calibration results
   _detectionCooldown = _backgroundMotion > 100000 
       ? TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2.5)
       : TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1.5);
   ```

This calibration ensures the app works well in various lighting conditions and with different webcam qualities.

   - Implementing transfer learning from larger pre-trained models
   - Supporting a library of 20+ specific stretching exercises

2. **Posture Analysis**: Feedback on stretch quality and form
   - Real-time correction suggestions for improper form
   - Tracking improvement in stretching technique over time
   - Personalized difficulty adjustment based on flexibility

3. **Personalized Recommendations**: Custom stretch suggestions based on user history
   - Analyzing stretching patterns to identify areas needing focus
   - Recommending targeted exercises for specific muscle groups
   - Adapting to user preferences and physical capabilities

These enhancements will make the app more accurate in detecting genuine stretching movements and reduce false positives.
