# Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to start using Stretch Reminder App and incorporate healthy stretching habits into your workday.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nitint27may/StretchReminderApp/releases)
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions
3. Launch the app from your Start menu or desktop shortcut

## Initial Setup

When you first launch Stretch Reminder App, a quick setup wizard will help you:

1. Configure reminder frequency (default: every 60 minutes)
2. Set the number of stretches required per session (default: 5 stretches)
3. Adjust detection sensitivity based on your environment
4. Choose notification preferences

## Using the App

### Daily Use

The app runs in the background, displaying a system tray icon for quick access. When it's time to stretch:

1. A notification will appear on your screen
2. Click "Start Stretching" to begin a session
3. Your webcam will open in the stretch detection window
4. Perform the required number of stretches
5. The app will automatically detect and count your movements
6. When completed, the session will be recorded to your statistics

### Manual Sessions

You can also start a stretching session at any time:

1. Open the main window from the system tray icon
2. Click the "Start Stretching" button
3. Complete your stretches as normal

## Calibrating the Motion Detection

For best results, the app needs to calibrate to your environment:

1. When the stretch window opens, remain still for a few seconds
2. The app will calibrate to establish your baseline motion level
3. After calibration, make large, obvious stretching movements
4. The app will detect these movements and count them as stretches

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Detected

If your webcam isn't being detected:

1. Check that your webcam is properly connected
2. Ensure you've granted camera permissions to the app
3. Restart the app after connecting your camera

### Motion Not Detecting Properly

If your stretches aren't being detected correctly:

1. Open Settings and increase the pose detection sensitivity
2. Ensure you have adequate lighting in your environment
3. Make your stretching movements larger and more deliberate
4. Position yourself to be fully visible in the camera frame
